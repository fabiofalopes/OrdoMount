# 🚧 Ordo Production Ready Status

## 🗓️ Today’s outcome — 2025-09-05

- Recovered rclone bisync state with a clean `--resync` (don’t interrupt). This rebuilt the missing listings in `~/.cache/rclone/bisync/…path{1,2}.lst`.
- Small-file propagation is back: a file created on the Mac appeared in OneDrive Web and then locally; a local note appeared in OneDrive after the recovery.
- Sync wrapper hardened further:
   - Retry/backoff and stale lock cleanup remain in place.
   - Added ORDO_FORCE_RESYNC=1 to force `--resync` when needed.
   - Verify and Report commands documented below; excludes toggle (ORDO_USE_EXCLUDES) retained.
- Monitoring showed that “frozen” terminals were just quiet phases (listing/compare) while rclone was active (high CPU). Use log timestamps instead of assuming a hang.

### ✅ Stability checklist (quick)
- [ ] Only one bisync instance running (check PID and lock file).
- [ ] No external shell timeout killing long runs.
- [ ] First-run or recovery `--resync` completed without interruption.
- [ ] `.rclone-bisync-state` present on the local path after success.
- [ ] Exclusions file correct for your use case.
- [ ] `./scripts/ordo-sync.sh verify` reports “In sync”.

### 🛠️ Operational runbook (lean)
- Start a sync once: `./scripts/ordo-sync.sh sync`
- Force a recovery resync: `ORDO_FORCE_RESYNC=1 ./scripts/ordo-sync.sh sync`
- Verify safely (no changes): `./scripts/ordo-sync.sh verify`
- Morning snapshot: `./scripts/ordo-sync.sh report`
- Background daemon (periodic): `./scripts/ordo-sync.sh daemon`
- Toggle exclusions:
   - With filters (default): `ORDO_USE_EXCLUDES=1 ./scripts/ordo-sync.sh sync`
   - Literal (no filters): `ORDO_USE_EXCLUDES=0 ./scripts/ordo-sync.sh sync`

Monitoring tips:
- Check if rclone is working: `pgrep -fa "rclone bisync"`
- Inspect work dir: `rclone lsl "$HOME/.cache/rclone/bisync"`
- Tail progress: `tail -n 100 -f ordo/logs/ordo-sync.log` (look for timestamp changes)
- If a lock lingers but PID is gone, the wrapper will clean it on next run.

Known gotchas:
- If logs show “Bisync aborted. Must run --resync to recover.”, run a clean `--resync` (or use ORDO_FORCE_RESYNC=1 via the wrapper) and let it finish.
- Avoid running multiple bisyncs in parallel on the same pair.
- OneDrive may delay server-side indexing; give it a few minutes before verifying via web UI.

## 🎯 Current Status: Implementation Phase

Ordo architecture has been designed and streamlined, but real-world testing revealed critical issues that need resolution before production deployment.

## � Reral-World Testing Results

### ✅ Architecture Completed
- 5 focused scripts designed and implemented
- Local-first approach with background sync
- Cache system eliminated (was unnecessary complexity)
- Clear separation: local work, remote browsing

### ❌ Critical Issues Discovered

**1. File Explorer Blocking (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: Dolphin (KDE file manager) freezes completely when network connection drops
- **Impact**: Entire file manager becomes unresponsive, requires force-kill
- **Current**: Using old mount approach in `~/mounts/` (not production-ready location)
- **Root cause**: File manager tries to access remote mount during network interruption

**2. Mount Location Non-Compliant**
- **Problem**: Currently mounting to `~/mounts/onedrive-f6388` and `~/mounts/g-drive-f6388`
- **Should be**: FHS-compliant `/media/$USER/` locations
- **Impact**: Not following Linux filesystem standards

**3. Interrupted Sync Recovery**
- **Problem**: OneDrive Documents sync interrupted at 17% (12GB of ~70GB total)
- **Impact**: Local `~/Documents/` now inconsistent with remote
- **Need**: Clean recovery mechanism for interrupted syncs

**4. Network Reliability Issues**
- **Problem**: Extremely slow sync speeds (near 0 Mbps) causing timeouts
- **Impact**: Cannot complete initial sync of Documents folder
- **Need**: Better handling of poor network conditions

### 🚀 Production Usage

#### One-Time Setup
```bash
./setup.sh
```

#### Daily Commands
```bash
./scripts/status.sh                    # Check everything
./scripts/ordo-sync.sh status         # Check sync targets
```

#### Application Configuration
```bash
# Point applications to LOCAL paths only:
Obsidian → ~/ObsidianVaults/MyVault/
IDE      → ~/Documents/MyProject/
Editor   → ~/Documents/important.txt

# NOT to remote mounts:
# ❌ /media/$USER/onedrive/Documents/...
```

### ✅ Cache System Eliminated

**Why cache was removed:**
- **Old approach**: Applications accessed remote mounts → needed VFS cache
- **New approach**: Applications access local files → no cache needed
- **Background sync**: Acts as the "cache" by keeping files truly local
- **Browsing mounts**: Use minimal/no cache (just for exploration)

**Benefits of no cache:**
- ✅ No cache directory to manage
- ✅ No cache size limits to configure  
- ✅ No cache cleanup needed
- ✅ Simpler status reporting
- ✅ Less disk space usage
- ✅ Fewer moving parts to break

## 🎯 I
mmediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Address File Manager Blocking Issue

**Problem Analysis:**
- Dolphin freezes when accessing remote mounts during network drops
- Current mounts in `~/mounts/` (non-standard location)
- Need graceful handling of connection losses

**Solutions to Test:**
1. **Manual Mount/Unmount Workflow**
   - Mount only when needed for browsing/backup
   - Unmount before network changes
   - Clear user workflow for mount management

2. **Improved Mount Options**
   - Add timeout options to rclone mount
   - Use `--daemon-timeout` and `--vfs-cache-mode` minimal
   - Test different mount parameters for stability

3. **Alternative File Manager Testing**
   - Test with Nautilus, Thunar, PCManFM
   - Identify which handles network drops better
   - Document best practices per file manager

### Step 2: Move to Production Mount Locations

**Current State:**
```bash
# OLD (non-compliant)
~/mounts/onedrive-f6388/
~/mounts/g-drive-f6388/

# NEW (FHS-compliant)
/media/$USER/onedrive-f6388/
/media/$USER/g-drive-f6388/
```

**Migration Plan:**
1. Unmount current locations
2. Update scripts to use `/media/$USER/`
3. Test KDE integration
4. Verify Dolphin sidebar integration

### Step 3: Handle Interrupted Sync State

**Current Situation:**
- `~/Documents/` has partial sync (17% complete)
- 12GB downloaded, ~58GB remaining
- Inconsistent state between local and remote

**Recovery Options:**
1. **Clean Restart** (Recommended)
   - Backup current `~/Documents/` 
   - Clear local copy
   - Restart full sync with better network

2. **Resume Sync**
   - Use rclone's resume capabilities
   - Verify integrity of existing files
   - Continue from where it stopped

### Step 4: Test Target Configuration

**Goal Configuration:**
```bash
# Local sync target (always available)
~/Documents/ ↔ onedrive:Documents

# Remote browsing (when needed)
/media/$USER/onedrive-f6388/ → full OneDrive access
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Obsidian vault access (`~/Documents/Obsidian_Vault_01/`)
- [ ] File editing and sync verification
- [ ] Network drop during file manager browsing
- [ ] Large file sync performance
- [ ] Bidirectional sync conflict resolution

## 🔧 Quick Commands for Current Session

**Check current state:**
```bash
mount | grep rclone
ls -la ~/Documents/ | wc -l
du -sh ~/Documents/
```

**Safe unmount (if needed):**
```bash
cd ~/projetos/hub/OrdoMount/ordo
./scripts/unmount-all.sh
```

**Test file manager stability:**
```bash
# Open Dolphin to mounted location
dolphin ~/mounts/onedrive-f6388 &
# Disconnect network, observe behavior
# Document freezing/timeout behavior
```
